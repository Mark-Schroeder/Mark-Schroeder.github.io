      <h1>Personal Information</h1> 
      <h6>My name is Mark Schroeder, and I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology (IT). I have a   European family history with half of my lineage being German and the other half, Russian. I, however, am your average Aussie from South-Eastern Melbourne. My Mother is a Russian who was born and raised in a once communist-Soviet Ukraine; she migrated to Australia with her now husband. Sadly, half of my extended family is weathering war as I write this. Please have your thoughts and prayers with the people of Ukraine during this tough time.</h6>      
      <h6 >I hold a Certificate III in Information Digital Media Technology and a Certificate II in Small Business (Innovations/Operations). I also studied software development in my Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) and look forward to developing these skills further. </h6> 
      <h6>I play the guitar for fun, I have a cat named Monty, and I have two older brothers.</h6>

      <h1>Interest in IT</h1>   
      <h6">I have always had a strong interest in technology. From a very young age it wouldn’t be an unusual occurrence to find me in my room pulling apart old VCR players, Walkmans, camera equipment and other assorted electronics. At the age of 12 I bought my first Arduino board and got straight into wiring little projects and devices together. This would be in concert with a limited but growing understanding of C++, the first programming language I experimented with.</h6>
      <h6>I continued to grow my knowledge of technology in high school where I did IT and software development subjects. After high school I landed an IT traineeship at Crest education, a college consisting of 2 schools with Early Learning to Year 12 educational facilities. During this traineeship I completed my Certificate III in Information Digital Media Technology and gained invaluable experience in the IT industry. I am currently still employed by Crest Education and
         hope to remain there for years to come. </h6>

      <h1>Why RMIT?</h1>
      <h6>I am striving to further my knowledge and expertise in the IT field and thus, I am commencing my Bachelor of IT at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). But why RMIT? RMIT has ‘more than 96,000 students and 9,000 staff globally’ (RMIT University 2020, para. 1) and is having an impact on the world through research, and innovation (RMIT University 2020). I am someone who wants to conduct research innovatively in new and upcoming areas, and RMIT is doing this. RMIT has a diverse cohort as in 2020, 47% of students were female and 20% were on shore internationals (RMIT University 2020). This makes it clear to me that RMIT is an accepting and inclusive community, this is another reason why I chose this university.</h6>      
       <h6 >In my studies at RMIT I aim to garner an in depth and thorough understanding of technological systems, how to use them and how to build them. I am always looking for ways to further my technical skills, and formal education in technology looks to be like an enthralling, difficult and yet satisfying avenue. I hope this turns out to be true and I look forward to what this degree will teach me.</h6>

      <h3>What does an IT manager do and why do I want to be one?</h3>
    <p>An IT manager is a person who coordinates and allocates resources within a business toward the technology side of operations and big picture strategy. In this position, the IT manager will lead a team in an office and from home to better the ability of Assurant to carry out day to day operations. This will involve scripting, using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), managing database technologies, etc. In recent months, Information Technology Manger roles were usually advertised to award between one hundred thousand and one hundred and sixty thousand dollars per annum (Seek 2022).   This level of salary is very appealing to me.
    </p>
    One day, I would like to become an IT manager as I believe that once I have enough knowledge and skills in the IT space, I will be an ideal candidate for this position. This is also because I believe I have good allocation and management skills while possessing a strong innate passion for technology. I am also draw to management because it is not all technical work, emotions and human connection are also factors of this job. This can prevent the position from becoming mundane and boring however, it can sometimes complicate aspects of the job to an unwanted level. 
    The skills required for this position are extensive and mainly technical. Many of these skills would be developed (not strictly though) through formal education, i.e. IT or Computer Science degrees. These skills could also be developed through years of experience in the IT field. Personally, I aim to work in the IT industry while I study so that when I complete my degree I have roughly 3-5 years of experience and a bachelor’s degree while also holding other formal accreditations. As mentioned earlier, I have had 1 year of experience in IT, and I have a certificate III in Information Digital Media Technology. I will build on this as I complete my Bachelor of IT at RMIT so that I can be a successful candidate in a job like the one above.

      <h1>What did I learn from this?</h1>   
      <p>These tests have revealed to me that I am a confident and assertive person who is not afraid to have constructive input in varying social situations, hence the ‘debater’ personality type. It has also highlighted that I have logical thinking traits among other masculine characteristics. This is also evident in the ‘Test My Creativity’ test where I scored a lower-than-average creativity score. It is argued that computer programming requires the ability to problem solve (Ali, 2020), and my test results indicate that I possess intuitive energy and a higher than average ‘complexity’, in terms of creativity. This indicates that I am a good problem solver and in turn, suggests that I possess some qualities of a good computer programmer. My assertiveness trait can have an influence on my performance within a team as this can elicit qualities of leadership. This can be very useful to a team as it can provide direction and encouragement which can bolster the team’s ability to meet deadlines. </p>

<br><br>

<div  class="w3-center">
  <h1>The Automatic Picture Printer</h1>
  <br>
<div class="w3-center, w3-content">
  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>The Automatic picture printer will be a Windows Form Application that gives a user three options (3 buttons). The options would be: “Cat”, “Dog” and “NASA”. When the user clicks on one of these options, the program will use Application Programming Interfaces (API) to fetch images of a cat, dog or of space (depending on which button they select), from the internet. This (some-what random) image would then directly print to the user’s default printer. This would be a fun surprise when it comes out of the printer as the user does not fully know what to expect, giving an element of surprise!</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Motivation</h4>
  <p>Weiss et al. (2012) found that generally, people have an interest in the way dogs look. This in addition to the element of surprise will hopefully make an exiting application that users will love. Additionally, this application would allow the user to see something cute and or inspiring in the real world with just one click of a button. By doing this, people who use this application daily, will hopefully have a smile on their face when they see an image of an adorable puppy, or a deep sense of awe when they see an image of deep space. This has the potential to bring positivity to some one’s day, and hopefully excite them about space technology and exploration. </p>
  <br>
  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>The application will be a Windows Form Application written in C# that would be available to the public through a download link on a website or the Microsoft store. As discussed earlier, when the user opens the application, they will have options for what sort of image they want to receive, and when they select a button, the app will search the web for an appropriate image. The application will search through existing databases with the images and any other relevant information, request it, decode it (if needed) and send it to the user’s default printer. The application would give the user a message regarding whether the execution of the program was successful or not. In the event of the application failing, the app should parse an error message to the user through a message box or a printout onto the existing window.  A possible drawback of the app is that many will want to have more options to choose from. This can be combatted by being open to feedback from users and by asking for reviews, for example, doing surveys, etc. </p>
  <h4>Tools and Technology</h4> 
  <p>To build this I will use Visual Studio to create the Windows Form App. One of the reasons I like Visual Studio is because I find it easy to prototype different layouts of forms. This gives me flexibility when designing, creating, and rapidly iterating through ideas for the product. I can easily place and program each button and change functionality of each attribute very quickly. Beyond the application that the user will see will be code that executes the user’s input. The language I have chosen to use for this is C# (pronounced ‘C sharp’), ‘a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language’ (Microsoft 2022, para. 1). Because C# is regularly updated to support up and coming coding and design practices (Microsoft 2022), I am confident that the Automatic Picture Printer will be easily maintained and kept up to date with modern systems. C# can also ‘help create robust and durable applications’ (Microsoft 2022, para. 3) which gives me further confidence in its capabilities. </p>
  <p>Cool. But how will it actually work? How does it get the image from the internet? In a C# application you can make HTTP requests to the GitHub REST service (Microsoft 2021). This would allow you to get JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data directly into your program. ‘JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format’ (json.org n.d.). After you deserialize the response (JSON data) from the repository, you can use that object for what you please within your program, for example, display the data in your console. This is useful if we want to gather data about what we are printing, or other useful data, for example, facts about what we are printing. </p>
  <p>Another method of requesting data from a website using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is by using the WebClient function (Microsoft 2022). The WebClient.DownloadFile method simply ‘downloads the resource with the specified URI to a local file’ (Microsoft 2022) which can then be used by the Automatic Picture Printer to send to the user’s printer. But where are the images coming from? You may ask. Cat images can be fetched <a href="https://docs.thecatapi.com/">here</a>, dog images can be fetched <a href="https://dog.ceo/dog-api/">here</a>, and NASA images can be fetched <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/">here</a>.</p>
  <h4>Skills required</h4>
  <p>To complete this project, I will need to be able to code in C#, do basic design, understand how to use APIs, understand JSON and other file/data types, and know how to put all these things together to produce the finished application. The creation of this product will also require much patience as these things can get very frustrating when they are not working as intended. Research skill will also be needed when I am unsure of how to go about parts of the development. This research can be done through reading documentation or interacting with coding communities on forums. </p>
  <h4>Outcome</h4>  
  <p>If the Automatic Picture Printer project was to be made, users would be able to have a fun and surprising product that can hopefully bring joy to their day. When they select a button, they will be greeted, in the real world, with a somewhat randomized image from the internet.</p>
