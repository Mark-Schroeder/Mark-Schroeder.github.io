      <h1>Personal Information</h1> 
      <h6>My name is Mark Schroeder, and I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology (IT). I have a   European family history with half of my lineage being German and the other half, Russian. I, however, am your average Aussie from South-Eastern Melbourne. My Mother is a Russian who was born and raised in a once communist-Soviet Ukraine; she migrated to Australia with her now husband. Sadly, half of my extended family is weathering war as I write this. Please have your thoughts and prayers with the people of Ukraine during this tough time.</h6>      
      <h6 class="w3-text-dark-grey">I hold a Certificate III in Information Digital Media Technology and a Certificate II in Small Business (Innovations/Operations). I also studied software development in my Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) and look forward to developing these skills further. </h6> 
      <h6>I play the guitar for fun, I have a cat named Monty, and I have two older brothers.</h6>

      <h1>Interest in IT</h1>   
      <h6">I have always had a strong interest in technology. From a very young age it wouldn’t be an unusual occurrence to find me in my room pulling apart old VCR players, Walkmans, camera equipment and other assorted electronics. At the age of 12 I bought my first Arduino board and got straight into wiring little projects and devices together. This would be in concert with a limited but growing understanding of C++, the first programming language I experimented with.</h6>
      <h6>I continued to grow my knowledge of technology in high school where I did IT and software development subjects. After high school I landed an IT traineeship at Crest education, a college consisting of 2 schools with Early Learning to Year 12 educational facilities. During this traineeship I completed my Certificate III in Information Digital Media Technology and gained invaluable experience in the IT industry. I am currently still employed by Crest Education and
         hope to remain there for years to come. </h6>

    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1>Why RMIT?</h1>
      <h6>I am striving to further my knowledge and expertise in the IT field and thus, I am commencing my Bachelor of IT at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). But why RMIT? RMIT has ‘more than 96,000 students and 9,000 staff globally’ (RMIT University 2020, para. 1) and is having an impact on the world through research, and innovation (RMIT University 2020). I am someone who wants to conduct research innovatively in new and upcoming areas, and RMIT is doing this. RMIT has a diverse cohort as in 2020, 47% of students were female and 20% were on shore internationals (RMIT University 2020). This makes it clear to me that RMIT is an accepting and inclusive community, this is another reason why I chose this university.</h6>      
       <h6 >In my studies at RMIT I aim to garner an in depth and thorough understanding of technological systems, how to use them and how to build them. I am always looking for ways to further my technical skills, and formal education in technology looks to be like an enthralling, difficult and yet satisfying avenue. I hope this turns out to be true and I look forward to what this degree will teach me.</h6>

      <h3>What does an IT manager do and why do I want to be one?</h3>
    <p>An IT manager is a person who coordinates and allocates resources within a business toward the technology side of operations and big picture strategy. In this position, the IT manager will lead a team in an office and from home to better the ability of Assurant to carry out day to day operations. This will involve scripting, using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), managing database technologies, etc. In recent months, Information Technology Manger roles were usually advertised to award between one hundred thousand and one hundred and sixty thousand dollars per annum (Seek 2022).   This level of salary is very appealing to me.
    </p>
    One day, I would like to become an IT manager as I believe that once I have enough knowledge and skills in the IT space, I will be an ideal candidate for this position. This is also because I believe I have good allocation and management skills while possessing a strong innate passion for technology. I am also draw to management because it is not all technical work, emotions and human connection are also factors of this job. This can prevent the position from becoming mundane and boring however, it can sometimes complicate aspects of the job to an unwanted level. 
    The skills required for this position are extensive and mainly technical. Many of these skills would be developed (not strictly though) through formal education, i.e. IT or Computer Science degrees. These skills could also be developed through years of experience in the IT field. Personally, I aim to work in the IT industry while I study so that when I complete my degree I have roughly 3-5 years of experience and a bachelor’s degree while also holding other formal accreditations. As mentioned earlier, I have had 1 year of experience in IT, and I have a certificate III in Information Digital Media Technology. I will build on this as I complete my Bachelor of IT at RMIT so that I can be a successful candidate in a job like the one above.

      <h1>What did I learn from this?</h1>   
      <p>These tests have revealed to me that I am a confident and assertive person who is not afraid to have constructive input in varying social situations, hence the ‘debater’ personality type. It has also highlighted that I have logical thinking traits among other masculine characteristics. This is also evident in the ‘Test My Creativity’ test where I scored a lower-than-average creativity score. It is argued that computer programming requires the ability to problem solve (Ali, 2020), and my test results indicate that I possess intuitive energy and a higher than average ‘complexity’, in terms of creativity. This indicates that I am a good problem solver and in turn, suggests that I possess some qualities of a good computer programmer. My assertiveness trait can have an influence on my performance within a team as this can elicit qualities of leadership. This can be very useful to a team as it can provide direction and encouragement which can bolster the team’s ability to meet deadlines. </p>
